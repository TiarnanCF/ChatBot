# 📄 Sentiment Detection ChatBot

## ℹ️ Overview

Control ChatBot responses based on classification of the user's query response. This is a work in progress. Currently the response is only different for negative sentiments. This idea was inspired by the [risks of AI in therapy](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/06/ai-mental-health-care-tools-dangers-risks), which shows how AI can often fail to pick up on suicidal thoughts.

The work around that is proposed is that we control the ChatBot's response based on custom classifiers. The basic ChatBot will have a built-in option for an alternative response for messages classified as having "negative" sentiment. The project will be LLM and Embedding model agnostic. By default open source models will be used but those can be override by the ChatBotBuilder.
